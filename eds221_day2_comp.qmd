# Vectors

```{r}
#create a vector
dogs <- c("teddy", "khora", "waffle", "banjo", "tallie")
#check class
class(dogs)

```

putting a mix of data types

```{r}
cats <- c("creamsicle wolf", 14.2, 3L)
class(cats)
#reverts the data type to the most flexible form
#find object three
cats[1]
```

```{r}
years <- c(20, 40, 16, 2)
class(years)
#not stored as integers because no L
#get more specific data type
typeof(years)
```

Ask questions

```{r}
# Want to do a conditional check
#is. <<< asks questions "is this THIS"
# as. <<< gives command "make this THIS"

is.numeric(years)
is.character(years)
```

```{r}
dog_food <-c(teddy = "purina", khora = "alpo", waffle = "fancy feast")
#added names to vector, teddy, khora and waffle w/ values in quotation marks. 
# can call by position
dog_food[2]
#or name
dog_food["khora"]
```
